          No more generic prep materials. 66 Days gave me personalized practice cases that matched my target firms.<br /><br />Landed offers at two top consulting firms. This app was a game-changer.

          Amazing for banking interviews. The AI picked up on my weak spots in valuation and drilled me until I had it down cold.

          Honestly, it works better than my $2000 interview coach. Real-time feedback on my case responses was incredible.<br /><br />Thank you for creating such an amazing app!

          66 Days tracked my progress across all interview types - case, fit, technical. Finally felt confident walking into Goldman.
